                    <p class="card-text">Construction is messy, stressful, and expensive. Make time during your project to find extra ways to
                        relax and soothe yourself. Trust your own process. Remodeling involves thousands of decisions
                        and this can be taxing on the brain and nerves. Most of the building process is destructive,
                        messy, dirty, noisy, and building sites are generally unpleasant to live on.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Here are some of the ways we recommend you cope. Make space for the destruction/construction by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>go on vacation</li>
                        <li>set up a temporary or back-up living space</li>
                        <li>stay with family</li>
                        <li>camp out</li>
                        <li>temporarily move out</li>
